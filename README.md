üõ† Usage Guide

For Non-Chinese Researchers
1. Use the `English/` versions of all files
2. Column headers follow this convention:
   ‚Ä¢ `[Entity1]`, `[Entity2]`: Always refer to medical concepts

   ‚Ä¢ `[Metric]_[unit]`: All calculated values are explicitly labeled

Knowledge Graph Construction
These analytical outputs can:
‚Ä¢ Enhance existing KGs by importing the `*.rdf` files into Neo4j or RDF triplestores
